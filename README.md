# Overview

Notepad is a simple webapp for creating and storing notes. It also contains support for multiple users.

I hope to create a fun and easy note taking experience that can be accessed anywhere.

# Web Pages

This application has two main pages. The notes page and the user page. It also contains pages for
registering, logging in, and logging out, but these are inconsequential.

The notes page is a collection of all the user's current notes. Each note is pulled from a database which contains the notes title, content, and publish date.

The user page is meant for the user to manage their account. Right now, it simply displays the current user.
